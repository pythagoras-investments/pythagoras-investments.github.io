At Pythagoras, we are quantitative traders of cryptocurrencies. 
</p>

For investors, we offer a steady return stream which is uncorrelated to equity, fixed income or commodity markets. 
Cryptocurrencies present new opportunities for traders, technologists, and financial engineers to create novel financial products and strategies to generate consistent returns for investors with low downside volatility.
</p> 

<p>
For crypto fund managers, our fund of funds offers capital and advice to new or emerging crypto quant traders. 
</p>

For talented quants, we offer employment to work with us. We are the quant team in cryptocurrencies with the longest upstanding track record and reputation.
