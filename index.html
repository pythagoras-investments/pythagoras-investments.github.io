At Pythagoras, we are quantitative traders of cryptocurrencies. 

For investors, we offer a steady return stream with low downside volatility, which is uncorrelated to equity, fixed income or commodity markets. 
Cryptocurrencies present new opportunities for traders, technologists, and financial engineers to create off-the-beaten path markets and novel financial products. 
 
For crypto fund managers, our fund of funds offers capital and advice to new or emerging crypto quant traders. 
 
For talented quants, we offer employment to work with the quant team in cryptocurrencies with the longest upstanding track record and reputation in this asset class.
 
Our founder, Mitchell Dong is a serial entrepreneur who has spent 25 years running quant hedge funds trading in niche and exotic markets, such as physical uranium trading, algorithmic electricity trading and mutual fund market timing. 
Prior, he founded and built companies which developed solar, hydro and cogeneration power plants.
 
The Pythagoras team consists of quant traders and researchers, computer scientists and risk and money managers.
We are located in Singapore, Hong Kong, New York and Cambridge.
