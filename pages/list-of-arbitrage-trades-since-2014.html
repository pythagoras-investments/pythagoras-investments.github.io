<p>
The following are examples of arbitrage trades that Pythagoras has executed in our 8-year history. The rapid growth and complexities of cryptocurrencies have created excellent opportunities for
 arbitrage trading. Although specific trades may get “arbbed out”, new arbitrage opportunities continue to emerge.  
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cross-exchange
        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously bought bitcoin on Kraken and sold on Huobi </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cross-country arbitrage
        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously bought bitcoin in the USA and sold in Japan </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Basis trading
        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously bought bitcoin in the spot market and sold in the futures market, where there is a premium price in futures that expire in either one week, one month, or one quarter.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cash and carry trade
        <ul>
            <li>Same as basis trading.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Funding-rate trading
        <ul>
            <li>When the markets were bullish, retail investors bought crypto on margin via a perpetual contract and paid an interest or funding rate.  We took the other side, provided liquidity, and thus
     received the funding rate.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Funding rate arbitrage
        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously bought a perpetual with a low funding rate and sold a perpetual contract with a higher funding rate </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Liquidity arbitrage
        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously bought crypto on an exchange with high liquidity and sold on an exchange with less liquidity. Assumes a lead-lag relationship. This is essentially a cross-exchange arbitrage.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Time zone arbitrage
        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously bought in one time zone and sold in another time zone. Assumes a lead-lag relationship. This is essentially a cross-exchange arbitrage. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Weekend arbitrage
        <ul>
            <li>Put capital in place before weekends to wait for bigger arbitrage opportunities while fiat banks are closed on weekends. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Chinese New Year arbitrage
        <ul>
            <li>Bought BTC in China and sold BTC in USD markets during the Chinese New Year holidays when Chinese traders are off work. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Arbitrage between CEX and DEX
        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously bought on a centralized exchange and sold on a decentralized exchange, or vice versa. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Market making in Defi
        <ul>
            <li>Providing liquidity, posting bids and offers, making markets, and creating volume in order to earn reward tokens. Example: DYDX. </li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Providing liquidity to Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
        <ul>
            <li>Depositing crypto on a decentralized exchange to facilitate automated market making (AMM) and pairs swapping. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Yield farming
        <ul>
            <li>Yield mining, liquidity mining, providing liquidity on DEX, lending platforms, and other defi protocols to earn fees and rewards. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Volatility arbitrage (event-specific)
        <ul>
            <li>Bought options with unpriced or underpriced event risk.  </li>
            <li>Bought cheap puts on Luna on May 7, hedged them over the following days, and then closed them for maximum value. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Volatility arbitrage (general, centralized exchanges)
        <ul>
            <li>Bought cheap volatility which is sold into the market as a result of systematic, price-insensitive flow — such as auctions — which can clear at almost any price. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Volatility arbitrage (general, decentralized exchanges)

        <ul>
            <li>Bought BTC spot and selling BTC futures to harvest Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Diamond for free as a dividend. This is because the BTC spot split into two tokens and
     BTC futures settled only into one of the tokens, so that we kept the forked asset for free. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>ETH hard fork to ETH 1 (POW) and ETH 2 (POS)
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Bought ETH spot, sold ETH future at flat or contango, in anticipation of ETH futures going to discount which was caused by the ETH staking yield. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Market making with GMT, a fast-growing, highly liquid gaming token of StepN on DEX when it has large trading volume and volatility</li>
